# SIH25001 – Smart Water Quality Monitoring & Federated Learning Platform

## 📌 Overview

**SIH25001** is an innovative solution designed to monitor, analyze, and predict water quality parameters in real time using IoT-enabled sensors and a federated learning-based AI model. The project focuses on **decentralized data processing**, enabling secure and privacy-preserving model updates across multiple nodes without sharing raw data.

Our platform allows local devices to **collect water quality metrics** (pH, turbidity, TDS, temperature, chlorine levels, etc.), process them locally, and collaboratively improve the central model through federated learning — ensuring **data security, scalability, and adaptability** in low-connectivity areas.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* ✅ Real-time water quality data collection and visualization.
* ✅ Offline-first approach — works even in remote areas with poor connectivity.
* ✅ Federated learning to improve AI model accuracy without sharing raw data.
* ✅ User-friendly dashboard for data insights and anomaly detection.
* ✅ Scalable architecture suitable for government and community deployment.

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Streamlit (for dashboard & visualization)
* **Backend:** Python (Flask / FastAPI – optional), SQLite / MySQL (for local DBMS)
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow / PyTorch (for federated model)
* **Data Storage:** Local + Cloud Sync (Hybrid)
* **Deployment:** Docker-ready, can be hosted on-premise or cloud (AWS / Azure)

---

## ⚙️ Features

* 📊 **Interactive Dashboard:** View sensor readings in real time.
* 🔒 **Federated Learning:** Secure model updates without sharing raw data.
* 📡 **Offline Mode:** Stores data locally and syncs to cloud when online.
* 🧠 **Predictive Analysis:** Detect potential water contamination events.
* 🔔 **Alert System:** Notifies users when water quality exceeds safe limits.

Would you like me to include a **diagram** (system architecture + federated learning flow) in the README for better visualization? It will make it more appealing for SIH judges.


Here’s a clean **README.md** draft tailored for your SIH25001 project:
